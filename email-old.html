<h1>More Computer Science-oriented Tools on School Computers</h1>

<div class="content-main">

<p>
  Hi, I'm Luke Deen Taylor. I'm a technologically inclined New Paltz High School
  freshman, I'll be taking AP Computer Science next year.

  On behalf of myself and a few other students, I'd like to discuss the
  possibility of installing more computer science-oriented tools on school
  computers. Specifically, I'd love to see the following things available to
  students:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h4>
    Installation of an IDE besides Notepad++
    </h4>

    <p>
    Many high school computers have Notepad++ as a code editor installed.
    While Notepad++ is fine, it's a relatively antiquated text editor,
    lacking many productivity features found commonly in more modern text editors.
    Editors like <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a> feature code-completion, advanced syntax highlighting, and more
    out of the box. Atom also has linters available for languages such as JavaScript,
    which can help prevent mistakes in writing code by identifying them before
    execution time. I'd love to see Atom installed system-wide in coming years.
    </p>
  </li>


  <li>
    <h4>
      Installation of other browsers besides Internet Explorer
    </h4>
    <p>
      Keith in the IT department may remember being called by Dr. Weisenthal last
      year about installing Chrome on school computers. From what I can see, a
      halfhearted attempt was subsequently made to block its installation by
      blacklisting the <code>chrome.google.com</code> domain. However, Internet
      Explorer remains an awful, non-standards-compliant browser. It doesn't
      support many of the features of the modern web. Browsers such as Chrome
      not only offer a full, standards-compliant implementation of HTML, CSS
      and JavaScript, but also offer debugging tools far beyond the capabilities
      of those found in IE. Having
      <a href="https://google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a> installed on school
      computers would be very helpful
      (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil">it's not evil</a>).
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>
      Relaxation of computer AUP
    </h4>
    <p>
      The district has a computer acceptable use policy, designed to protect the security
      of district computers. However, this policy is, in my opinion, unnecessarily restrictive
      in several places.
    </p>
    <p>
      The computer use policy has not been modified or updated in several years to reflect how
      students need to use technology today. At least two of these rules are worded such that
      they are violated by normal, reasonable computer use. For example, launching Internet Explorer
      and conducting a Google search explicitly violates the rules stating that users may not:

      <pre>25. Run or copy executable programs for any drive on any of the district's computers
27. Send messages from one computer to another via the LAN or WAN
 9. Complete and/or submit forms found on websites without permission</pre>

      The act of launching internet explorer involves running an executable program for a drive on
      a district computer. Furthermore, navigating to any webpage on the internet, by definition,
      involves sending a message from one computer to another over "the WAN." Lastly, conducting a
      search involves completing and submitting a form found on a website. In fact, Google's input
      mechanism explicitly uses a HTML <code> &lt;form&gt;</code> element:
      <img alt="form" src="http://i.imgur.com/OE75CHf.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      The district's computer policies cannot be expected to be taken seriously when they clearly
      prevent normal computer use.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the clear mistakes in the policy, there are several rules that I feel are overly
      restrictive. For example, rule 24 states:
      <pre>24. Load software or executable files of any kind onto any of the district's computers or network server</pre>
      This rule, is, in my opinion, unnecessary. Without access to adminstrator privelages, no programs
      could be loaded which would inflict actual damage to the computers or the network, at least not without
      violating the rule:
      <pre>3. Create and/or place a computer virus onto any computer</pre>
      I think the computer AUP should undergo a much-needed update sometime very soon.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>
      Basic, non-admin command line access
    </h4>
    <p>
      While Windows is built on top of a graphical interface, familiarity with a basic
      command-line interface is an essential tool for students hoping to become developers.
      Currently, placing <code>cmd</code> in a <code>.bat</code> file and double-clicking
      it displays the message:
      <pre><code>The command prompt has been disabled by your administrator.
Press any key to continue . . .</code></pre>
      this restriction can be easily circumvented by a loop in the batch file:
      <pre><code>@echo off
:loop
set /P cmd="> "
%cmd%
goto :loop</code></pre>
      which simply passes user input to the command line, simulating an interactive shell:
      <img alt="cmd" src="http://i.imgur.com/Z420Ylq.png"/>
      Allowing non-admin command-line access would be hugely beneficial to students while
      not actually opening up any new security issues. This addition would not expose new
      functionality, but rather make information (which is already available) accessible
      in a much more powerful way.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>
      Installation of Git
    </h4>
    <p>
      While many computer science students would not take advantage of a
      version-control system such as git, since it is not a part of the curriculum,
      such software has enormous potential to transform code workflows.
    </p>
  </li>

</ol>

<p>
  I'd love to discuss these posibilities. Are there reasons why any of these
  could or could not be put in place? I'm open to feedback on these ideas.

<h1>B. Status of BYOD programs</h1>

<p>There have long been wifi networks in the district that mention a Bring
Your Own Device program. What is the status of such a project? Is this a program
planned for the future? </p>
