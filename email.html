<h1>More Computer Science-oriented Tools on School Computers</h1>

<div class="content-main">

<p>
  Hi, I'm Luke Deen Taylor. I'm a New Paltz High School
  freshman.

  On behalf of myself and a few other students, I'd like to discuss the
  possibility of installing more computer science-oriented tools on school
  computers. Specifically, a discussion surrounding the following items
  would be beneficial to many students:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h4>
    Installation of an IDE besides Notepad++
    </h4>

    <p>
    Many high school computers have Notepad++ as a code editor installed.
    However, more modern text editors like 
    <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a> feature code-completion, advanced syntax
    highlighting, as well as powerful extensibility out of the box. Atom also has
    linters available for languages including JavaScript, which can help prevent
    mistakes while writing code by identifying mistakes before execution time.
    </p>
  </li>


  <li>
    <h4>
      Installation of other browsers besides Internet Explorer
    </h4>
    <p>
      Browsers such as <a href="https://google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a> not only
      offer a full, standards-compliant implementation of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
      but also offer debugging tools for those actively writing code. Having
      <a href="https://google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a> installed on school
      computers would be very helpful. I understand that this is something that's
      already in the works.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>
      Relaxation of computer AUP
    </h4>
    <p>
      The district has a computer acceptable use policy, designed to protect the security
      of district computers. However, this policy is very restrictive in several places.
    </p>
    <p>
      The computer use policy has not been modified or updated in several years to reflect how
      students need to use technology today. At least three of these rules are worded such that
      they are violated by normal, reasonable computer use, and many more are worded very ambiguously.
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if no policies are dropped, a the very least this policy should be updated to be more modern
      and reflect computer use today.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>
      Basic, non-admin command line access
    </h4>
    <p>
      Command-line skills are essential for those hoping to enter computer science-related professions of
      any kind. I understand that the command-line interface is currently blocked due to security concerns,
      however I am not aware of any use cases that would expose security concerns that would <i>not</i>
      require admin privelages. I understand this probably won't happen, but I'd appreciate if this could be
      further considered.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>
      Installation of Git
    </h4>
    <p>
      While many computer science students would not take advantage of a
      <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control">
      version-control system such as Git</a>, since it is not a part of the curriculum,
      such software has enormous potential to transform code workflows. Git tracks the
      state of a project as you "commit" changes, and then allows you to revert to previous
      versions of your files without losing future versions. It solves the problem of
      keeping multiple duplicates of files, and does so very elegantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Git also facilitates easy collaboration on coding projects. <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>
      hosts Git "repositories" for free, and exists as a great community surrounding programming. I
      personally <a href="https://github.com/The-Penultimate-Defenestrator">keep much of my code on GitHub</a>,
      which allows for others to contribute with ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the aformentioned editor <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> depends on
      Git for much of its functionality, namely installing packages and themes from
      <a href="https://atom.io/packages">the community</a>.
    </p>
  </li>

</ol>

<p>
  I'd love to discuss these posibilities. Are there reasons why any of these
  could or could not be put in place? I'm open to feedback on these ideas.

<h1>B. Status of BYOD programs</h1>

<p>There have long been wifi networks in the district that mention a Bring
Your Own Device program. What is the status of such a project? Is this a program
planned for the future? </p>
